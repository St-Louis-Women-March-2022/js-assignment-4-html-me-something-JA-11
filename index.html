         <p>My best friend went to grad school at the University of California, Irvine. I visited multiple times while she lived in southern California. These are some of the amazing adventures we had!</p>

               <h2>Baseball Games</h2>
               <p>I'm a big sports fan and Los Angeles has a lot of teams to watch. I went to see both the Los Angeles Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers play. The Dodgers' game was extra special because the Cardinals were in town and won!</p>

               <h2>Warner Bros. Studio Tour</h2>
               <p>I went on a tour of the Warner Bros. studio. We drove around on a tour cart and the guide showed us various TV and film sets. They gave behind the scene details and explained how stories are brought to life. We also explored the actual Central Perk set from Friends, ate at the Central Perk Cafe, and experienced the Harry Potter Sorting Hat. I was sorted into Gryffindor!</p>

               <h2>Disneyland</h2>
               <p>We went to Disneyland for my friend's birthday. It was our first time there and we will definitely go back again! We fit as many activities as we could into one jam packed day. We rode a bunch of rides, met Spiderman and Kylo Ren, visited the animation building, and stayed late for the Main Street Electrical Parade and the Fantasmic! nighttime show.</p>

               <h2>Hollywood</h2>
               <p>I'd never been to Los Angeles before, so of course, we had to visit a couple iconic places in Hollywood. The Hollywood Sign is one of the world's most famous landmarks. It was really cool to see in person and we had a little fun taking pictures with it. We also walked up and down the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We searched for stars on the ground, made a stop at Grauman's Chinese Theatre to see some famous hand and foot prints, and saw where Jimmy Kimmel Live! is taped.</p>

               <h2>San Diego</h2>
               <p>One day we took a mini road trip to San Diego. I love to play disc golf, and San Diego is home to Morley Field Disc Golf Course. This course is one of the original disc golf courses in the world. It was beautiful, challenging, and very fun to play. After that, we took a ferry over to Coronado Island. We shopped, ate, and relaxed at the historic Hotel del Coronado beach resort.</p>

               <h2>Helicopter Ride</h2>
               <p>One of the coolest things I've ever done is riding in a helicopter. We took a helicopter tour along the coast of southern Calfornia. We saw many landmarks, mansions, and beaches including Laguna Beach.</p>

               <h2>Catalina Island</h2>
               <p>One of my favorite places I've ever been to is Catalina Island. Since people can't drive motor vehicles to or on the island, the only way to get there is to fly or ride the ferry. We rode on the Catalina Flyer ferry and had a blast exploring the island. We rented a golf cart and drove around, hung out at the beach, and kayaked in the ocean.</p>
